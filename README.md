# Releaseflow

> A Node.js command-line application for quickly creating all release files.

## Why will it help me?
After a release build is ready for deployment, there are a _lot_ of tasks to be completed. This program helps organize all those steps, and has various advantages over other deployment applications:
- Automatically:
	- Generates documentation, including information from the project's changelog
	- Builds the executable
	- Packs source code into a ZIP or other specified compression format
- Compatible with Node.js, Maven (coming soon), and many other project formats
- Installable via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (coming soon)

## Where do I get it?
As of now, this project is only available by compiling the source. Soon, the application will be installable via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
